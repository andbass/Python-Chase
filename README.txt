This is an upload of my 2D racing game in Python for my Game Development class in High School
The original readme is as follows:

Hello!

To play my game, just run the main.py file.
You must have the pygame library installed aswell.

The controls are as follows:
    Arrow keys: drive car
    R: reset scene

That's it!

Your goal is to avoid getting hit by the police car.  The cop gets faster as the game goes on.
Have fun!
