This is an upload of my 2D racing game in Python for my Game Development class in High School
All art asserts are from the classic 1999 video game, Grand Theft Auto 2
The original readme is as follows:

Hello!

To play my game, just run the main.py file.
You must have the pygame library installed aswell.

The controls are as follows:
    Arrow keys: drive car
    R: reset scene

That's it!

Your goal is to avoid getting hit by the police car.  The cop gets faster as the game goes on.
Have fun!
